# Testing Go Projects

Implementing test code for Go projects and its continuous execution is an integral activity to ensure that the software is ready for prime time. As developers, we often claim that certain pieces of software are untestable. It either has dependencies on actual services like a database or an HTTP API, requires extensive setups, or simply isn’t structured properly to set yourself up for success.

Testing doesn’t have to be hard. In this training, you’ll learn the ropes of writing and executing tests with the standard testing package. Moreover, you’ll apply proven testing techniques to verify hard-to-test code regularly encountered in real-world projects.

## Prerequisites
