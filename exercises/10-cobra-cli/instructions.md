# Exercise 10

In this exercise, you will write a test case for a CLI-based program that uses the Cobra library. You will be able to use the recipe to implement tests for your own CLI programs without having to actually execute the binary.

1. Navigate to the directory `start`. You will find an existing Go project.
2. Inspect the functionality of the project.
3. Create a new test file name `calc_test.go`.
4. Write a test case that verifies the logic in the "add" command.
5. Verify the expected outcome of the calculation.
6. (Optional) Implement other test cases for this code if you have extra time.
